# Twitter_Sentiment_Challenge


This is code for the Twitter Sentiment Analysis challenge from "Learn Python for Data Science #2" by Siraj Raval. The code makes use of the
tweepy library to access the Twitter api, performs sentiment analysis on tweets with a given keyword and saves the results to Excel and 
CSV files.
